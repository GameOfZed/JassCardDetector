# JassCardDetector
JassCardDetector is a project for recognizing Jass playing cards using image processing and neural networks. It focuses on edge detection to identify card boundaries and a machine learning model for card classification, even in complex scenarios like overlapping cards. Ideal for enthusiasts in AI and traditional card games.





*Project structure:*

1. **Data**: This folder will contain the datasets you use for training and testing your neural network. It can be further subdivided into:
   - **Raw**: Original, unprocessed images of Jass cards.
   - **Processed**: Images after preprocessing (e.g., converted to grayscale, cropped, etc.)
   - **Labels**: Annotations or labels for each image, possibly in a structured format like JSON or CSV.

2. **Models**: This directory should contain the neural network models you develop or experiment with. Inside, you could have:
   - **TrainedModels**: Save the trained model files here (e.g., .h5, .ckpt files).
   - **Scripts**: Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks used for training and evaluating models.

3. **Src** (Source): Contains all the source code of the project.
   - **EdgeDetection**: Scripts for the edge detection part of your project.
   - **CardRecognition**: Code specific to the card recognition neural network.
   - **Utils**: Any utility scripts or helper functions.

4. **Docs**: Documentation of your project, including setup instructions, methodology, and usage guidelines.

5. **Tests**: Unit tests and integration tests to ensure your code works as expected.

6. **Output**: Store the output of your model here, like processed images, prediction results, etc.

7. **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for demonstrations, experiments, and exploratory data analysis.

8. **Requirements**: A requirements.txt file for listing all the Python dependencies.

9. **License**: A file containing the chosen license for your project.

10. **README.md**: A detailed README file explaining the project's purpose, how to set it up, how to use it, and any other necessary information for users and contributors.
